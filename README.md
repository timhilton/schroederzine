# The Schroeder Zine

Visit the site [here](https://schroederzine.com)

This is the codebase to the Schroeder Zine site. It's written in react with entirely too much Sass. We should probably figure out a better way of doing this.

In 1995 the Schroeder Zine was launched to no acclaim. For no apparent reason, 25 years after the last issue, we've decided to bring it back. We haven't matured much. It's gonna be stupid, starting with the fact that none of the links work yet. Over time it will improve, but not by much.
